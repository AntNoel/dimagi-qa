## Postman API

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs.\
We've built a collection that can be triggered manually and one that run's on every deploy activity.

To manually trigger the script,
  - Go to [Postman action](https://github.com/dimagi/dimagi-qa/actions/workflows/postman.yml)
  - Run workflow
  - Use workflow from ```master```
  - Run!

If you are a part of the QA team, you'll receive emails for the result of the run after it's complete.

Besides, you should be able to find the zipped results in the **Artifacts** section, of the corresponding run (after it's complete).
